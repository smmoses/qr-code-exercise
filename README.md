## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I relearned how to center something vertically and horizontally using flexbox. I am hoping doing this exercise will reinforce that ability.

### Continued development

While researching, I found multiple ways to vertically and horizontally center. I am still not sure what is considered the best practice.

I did have some issue with the breakpoints. I elected to use a 425px breakpoint for my small screens. It looks kind of tacky at that point. It can be fixed with different breakpoints. 

### Useful resources

- [Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was a good refresher for using flexbox.
